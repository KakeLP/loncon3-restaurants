summary: Small but well-stocked Chinese supermarket.  Storecupboard groceries include cup noodles, pickled vegetables, chilli sauces, and Chinese sweets and snacks.

access: Only a very small step to get in, manageable on wheels, but there isn’t much space to manoeuvre inside and it would be very tricky to get a wheelchair or pram in.

summary: Cantonese restaurant with a view over the Royal Docks and London City Airport; good for dim sum in large groups, particularly with children who enjoy the views of the planes.  Highchairs available for children, and baby-changing facilities in the accessible toilet.  Vegetarian dim sum options are very limited.
access: Step-free to the building from Royal Albert DLR (via a lift at the DLR station), though there are a few rough cobbled patches along the way. Also step-free from the (large, free) car park. Restaurant is on an upper floor but there’s a lift.  Accessible toilet on same level as restaurant with no intervening steps.

summary: Pub serving real ale and an extensive pub food/bistro menu, including traditional British Sunday lunches. Also open for breakfast. Hotel rooms upstairs.  Highchairs and children’s menu available, as well as a pull-down baby change table in the accessible toilet (which has a RADAR lock, but there’s a key behind the bar).  Only halal meat used.  A few vegetarian and vegan options.  Staff are willing to adapt dishes to suit special diets wherever possible.  There’s another branch (Fox ExCeL) at the other end of the ExCeL Centre, and the menu is the same at both.

Highchairs and children’s menu available, as well as a pull-down baby change table in the accessible toilet.  There’s another branch (Fox Connaught) at the other end of the ExCeL Centre, and the menu is the same at both.
access: Level access to top floor from ExCeL upper walkway, and to ground floor from the street.  Much of the seating on the ground floor is at high tables.   Walk-through lift from top floor to mezzanine (where an accessible toilet with baby change is located).  Another accessible toilet on ground floor (RADAR lock, no baby change facilities).  There are steps (with handrail) between the ground floor and mezzanine, so step-free access from ground floor to baby change (or from ground floor to top floor) requires leaving the building and taking a circuitous route involving ramps up to the main ExCeL entrance then going across the walkway.

Half-portions for children, and a pull-down baby change table in a room at the back.

Outdoor seating if the weather is good, on wooden jetties with a view of the preserved Stothert & Pitt cranes alongside the Royal Victoria Dock.

summary: Cafe in the Crystal, a Siemens initiative exploring urban sustainability.  The menu is small but changes every day, with dishes such as burgers and Mediterranean vegetable pasta.  Soups, salads, and cakes always available.  Everything (except some of the cakes) is made in-house.  At least one vegetarian option is always available, and the chef is happy to amend dishes to suit special diets wherever possible.  Ingredients are sourced mainly within a 20-mile radius, and all food waste is composted for use in the gardens outside.  Four highchairs, and a pull-down baby change facility in each toilet (men, women, accessible).  Children’s portions available whenever the menu allows (e.g. small portions of pasta are possible, small portions of burgers are not).

summary: Indian restaurant serving British curryhouse favourites plus house specials such as grilled garlic chilli paneer and grilled garlic lamb shank.  Plenty of vegetarian options, and vegetable oil is used instead of ghee so vegan is also possible.  Highchairs and half portions for children.
access: Step to get in, but portable ramp available.  Two steps to toilets, and access is narrow.  Dim lighting.

summary: Small cafe-style restaurant offering Filipino dishes such as adobo (a savoury and slightly sour pork stew) plus pan-Asian extras.  Try the halo-halo for a cooling dessert on a hot day.  Vegetarian options are sparse, but include pancit guisado (wok-fried rice vermicelli with vegetables).  All food is halal.
access: Step-free to get in. Tiny step to toilets. Ladies’ cubicle door opens outwards, men’s opens inwards and is a bit of a squeeze.

summary: A dual menu offers Northern Chinese specialities as well as the usual standard Anglicised Chinese food. Much of the specialities menu is written in Chinese-only, but a fair selection of it is translated and illustrated, and staff are happy to help with recommendations from the rest. Hotpot (steamboat) is also available, with a wide range of ingredients. Decor and furnishings are fairly basic, but not uncomfortable.  Highchairs for children, but no baby change.  Vegetarians catered for.
access: A rudimentary ramp (really just a smoothed-over step) from the pavement to the area directly outside the door, and another shallow step to get in. It’s all essentially on one level once you’re in, though there is a slight change in level (not really enough to call it a step) on the way to the loos.

summary: "Pub with a large amount of outdoor riverside seating and steps down to the Thames “beach” at low tide.  Roast lunches on Sundays including a nut roast option (though vegetarian options in general are quite scarce).  Unusually for a pub, an (optional) 12.5% service charge is added to the bill.  Children’s menu based on a subset of the regular menu; highchairs available too.  Baby change is a pull-down table in the ladies’ toilet only.  Real ales on handpump."
access: No step in, just a small ridge at the threshold.  Another small ridge on the way to the toilets.  One large cubicle in each of ladies’ and gents’, but the door opens inwards.

summary: Cosy locals’ pub serving Young’s ales, guest ales from London breweries, and American craft beers. A short and focused menu offers traditional pub food such as fish and chips, sausage and mash, and home-made pheasant pie. Vegetarian options are scarce. Large beer garden at the back.
access: No steps at entrances, but steps down to the toilets from both bars. I think there was at least one step to the beer garden.

summary: Hidden away down a narrow pedestrian alleyway, this pub and restaurant consists of a pair of late 17th century houses, converted to a chop-house and coffee shop in the 18th century.  It now offers booth seating, real ales, bar snacks, and a daily-changing menu of traditional English food.  Two vegetarian options each day.
access: At least one step to get into the ground-floor dining room and bar. The restaurant and wine bar involve steep staircases. The ground floor passages are narrow and twisty, and the interior is very cramped.  Toilets are on the first floor and in the basement.

summary: "American BBQ restaurant, part of a small chain.  The atmosphere evokes an American bar, complete with live feeds of college and pro baseball, basketball, and American football.  Drinks include cocktails, American whiskies, and craft beers.  The food is heavy and hearty, and portions are large; smaller appetites will likely be content with an appetiser portion of ribs.  Vegetarian options are sparse.  “Family-style” platter meals are on offer for groups, and a children’s menu is available.  Gets very busy, and reservations are recommended on weekends."

summary: Pub very near London Bridge Station, housed in a grand building originally constructed to serve as the first branch of the National Westminster Bank, with interior feaures including a curved central staircase, mezzanine floor, frosted-glass privacy screens, and murals. Owned by Fuller’s, a well-known London brewery, and serving several of their real ales as well as competent pub food.  On football nights it gets quite busy, so bookings are only taken for dining on the mezzanine, and children are not permitted on the ground floor for safety reasons.  Highchairs and children’s menu available, but no baby change facilities.
access: Several steps at the entrance. The toilets are down a flight of stairs.

summary: Self-described “oyster & porter house” serving fish and seafood including around a dozen varieties of oyster.  Staff accustomed to providing gluten-free options due to several regular customers who require them; but vegetarian options unlikely.  A good selection of bottled stouts and porters as well as wine and cocktails.  Barrel seating at front, high tables further back (for which booking is recommended).  Fine to come in for just a drink at the front part.  Pushchairs and prams are not permitted, due to lack of space.
access: Tiny step to get in.  It’s quite small inside, and most of the seating is on high stools, though there is one small table at normal height.  There is an accessible toilet on the ground floor but access to this is quite narrow.

summary: Early-opening pub on the edge of Borough Market. Fast turnover keeps the real ale fresh but also means that rarer ales run out quickly.  Very busy and crowded at peak times.

Bookings taken for the restaurant only.  Children welcome but no highchairs or baby change facilities.
access: A step to get in.  RADAR-locked accessible toilet on ground floor, but limited seating.  A flight of stairs (with handrail) to get to the first-floor restaurant.

Vegan and gluten-free options are possible.  Bookable private dining room seats up to 10 people.  Large groups (14 or more) may be asked to order from a set menu.
access: A large step in, but there is a portable ramp available.  Toilets on the same level, including an accessible one, though the corridor to this is a little narrow.

Dishes include gobi 65 (deep-fried spiced cauliflower), curd vada (lentil-flour doughnut soaked in a yoghurt sauce), dosas (thin, crisp pancakes with a potato-based stuffing and spiced sauces on the side), and Indian-Chinese fusion such as paneer fried rice and vegetable Manchurian.  Vegan options are available on request.
