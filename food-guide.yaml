summary: A dual menu offers Northern Chinese specialities as well as the usual standard Anglicised Chinese food. Much of the specialities menu is written in Chinese-only, but a fair selection of it is translated and illustrated, and staff are happy to help with recommendations from the rest. Hotpot (steamboat) is also available, with a wide range of ingredients. Decor and furnishings are fairly basic, but not uncomfortable.
access: A rudimentary ramp (really just a smoothed-over step) from the pavement to the area directly outside the door, and another shallow step to get in. It's all essentially on one level once you're in, though there is a slight change in level (not really enough to call it a step) on the way to the loos.

access: No steps at entrances, but steps down to the toilets from both bars. I think there was at least one step to the beer garden.

summary: The brewery tap for Greenwich's Meantime Brewery, offering the full range of their beers. Beer garden at the back. Full a la carte menu plus sandwiches, more interesting than your average pub menu. Bar snacks might include calamari with wild garlic and squid ink alioli, or “pigs in blankets” (sausages wrapped in bacon),
access: No steps to enter, and the bar and garden are on the same level, but the toilets are down a flight of stairs.
