summary: Indian restaurant with a menu that goes beyond the usual British curryhouse staples.  A reasonable number of vegetarian options, few if any vegan.  Highchairs available for children.
access: A step to get in, but no further steps once you’re in.  Wide aisles, plenty of space for wheelchairs at tables.  Ladies’ toilet doubles as accessible toilet (large cubicle), though the way through to this is a little narrow and involves corners.

summary: Small but well-stocked Chinese supermarket.  Storecupboard groceries include cup noodles, pickled vegetables, chilli sauces, and Chinese sweets and snacks.  Frozen options include fish, seafood, steamed buns, and dim sum items.  A small fridge at the front holds fresh seafood such as prawns, squid, and razor clams, as well as fresh greens and fresh and fried tofu.
access: Only a very small step to get in, manageable on wheels, but there isn’t much space to manoeuvre inside and it would be very tricky to get a wheelchair or pram in.

Highchairs and children’s menu available, as well as a pull-down baby change table in the accessible toilet (which has a RADAR lock, but there’s a key behind the bar).  Only halal meat used.  A few vegetarian and vegan options.  Staff are willing to adapt dishes to suit special diets wherever possible.  There’s another branch (Fox ExCeL) at the other end of the ExCeL Centre, and the menu is the same at both.

summary: Small cafe-style restaurant offering Filipino dishes such as adobo (a savoury and slightly sour pork stew) plus pan-Asian extras.  Try the halo-halo for a cooling dessert on a hot day.  Vegetarian options are sparse, but include pancit guisado (wok-fried rice vermicelli with vegetables).  All food is halal.
access: Step-free to get in. Tiny step to toilets. Ladies’ cubicle door opens outwards, men’s opens inwards and is a bit of a squeeze.

summary: A dual menu offers Northern Chinese specialities as well as the usual standard Anglicised Chinese food. Much of the specialities menu is written in Chinese-only, but a fair selection of it is translated and illustrated, and staff are happy to help with recommendations from the rest. Hotpot (steamboat) is also available, with a wide range of ingredients. Decor and furnishings are fairly basic, but not uncomfortable.  Highchairs for children, but no baby change.  Vegetarians catered for.
access: A rudimentary ramp (really just a smoothed-over step) from the pavement to the area directly outside the door, and another shallow step to get in. It’s all essentially on one level once you’re in, though there is a slight change in level (not really enough to call it a step) on the way to the loos.

summary: "Pub with a large amount of outdoor riverside seating and steps down to the Thames “beach” at low tide.  Roast lunches on Sundays including a nut roast option (though vegetarian options in general are quite scarce).  Unusually for a pub, an (optional) 12.5% service charge is added to the bill.  Children’s menu based on a subset of the regular menu; highchairs available too.  Baby change is a pull-down table in the ladies’ toilet only.  Real ales on handpump."
access: Step-free (but small ridges at entrance and on way to toilets).  One large cubicle in each of ladies’ and gents’, but the door opens inwards.

summary: The brewery tap for Greenwich’s Meantime Brewery, offering the full range of their beers. Beer garden at the back. Full a la carte menu plus sandwiches, more interesting than your average pub menu. Bar snacks might include calamari with wild garlic and squid ink alioli, or “pigs in blankets” (sausages wrapped in bacon),
access: No steps to enter, and the bar and garden are on the same level, but the toilets are down a flight of stairs.

summary: Hidden away down a narrow pedestrian alleyway, this pub and restaurant consists of a pair of late 17th century houses, converted to a chop-house and coffee shop in the 18th century.  It now offers booth seating, real ales, bar snacks, and a daily-changing menu of traditional English food.  Two vegetarian options each day.
access: At least one step to get into the ground-floor dining room and bar. The restaurant and wine bar involve steep staircases. The ground floor passages are narrow and twisty, and the interior is very cramped.  Toilets are on the first floor and in the basement.

Highchair and children’s menu available; they recommend that children dine in the first-floor dining area rather than the ground floor, which gets very busy at peak times.  Vegetarian and gluten-free options available, and staff have access to an book listing all known allergens in ingredients.

summary: "American BBQ restaurant, part of a small chain.  The atmosphere evokes an American bar, complete with live feeds of college and pro baseball, basketball, and American football.  Drinks include cocktails, American whiskies, and craft beers.  The food is heavy and hearty, and portions are large; smaller appetites will likely be content with an appetiser portion of ribs.  Vegetarian options are sparse.  “Family-style” platter meals are on offer for groups, and a children’s menu is available.  Gets very busy, and reservations are recommended on weekends."

summary: Pub very near London Bridge Station, housed in a grand building originally constructed to serve as the first branch of the National Westminster Bank, with interior feaures including a curved central staircase, mezzanine floor, frosted-glass privacy screens, and murals. Owned by Fuller’s, a well-known London brewery, and serving several of their real ales as well as competent pub food.  On football nights it gets quite busy, so bookings are only taken for dining on the mezzanine, and children are not permitted on the ground floor for safety reasons.  Highchairs and children’s menu available, but no baby change facilities.
access: Several steps at the entrance. The toilets are down a flight of stairs.

summary: Self-described “oyster & porter house” serving fish and seafood including around a dozen varieties of oyster.  Staff accustomed to providing gluten-free options due to several regular customers who require them; but vegetarian options unlikely.  A good selection of bottled stouts and porters as well as wine and cocktails.  Barrel seating at front, high tables further back (for which booking is recommended).  Fine to come in for just a drink at the front part.  Pushchairs and prams are not permitted, due to lack of space.
access: Tiny step to get in.  It’s quite small inside, and most of the seating is on high stools, though there is one small table at normal height.  There is an accessible toilet on the ground floor but access to this is quite narrow.

summary: Early-opening pub on the edge of Borough Market, and a long-standing entry in the Campaign For Real Ale’s <cite>Good Beer Guide</cite>. Fast turnover keeps the real ale fresh but also means that rarer ales run out quickly.  Very busy and crowded at peak times.  Food served lunchtimes only from separate menus in the bar and upstairs dining room, with ingredients sourced from the market.  One or two vegetarian options.  Bookings taken for the restaurant only.  Children welcome but no highchairs or baby change facilities.

summary: "Traditional British pub in Plaistow, with several real ales on handpump.  A current entry in the Campaign For Real Ale’s <cite>Good Beer Guide</cite>.  Pub food served on weekdays (lunchtimes and early evening) including dishes such as ham, egg, and chips; jacket potatoes; steak and ale pie; and sandwiches.  Sometimes there’s a seafood stall in the car park too.  Vegetarian options are limited, but include jacket potatoes and omelettes.  Children are welcome, but there are no highchairs and no baby change facilities."
access: "The pub is on a number of different levels with steps between.  There is one small seating area that has level access from the street and to the toilets (which have rather small cubicles), but there are three steps from here to access the bar.  The pub has its own car park to the side."
