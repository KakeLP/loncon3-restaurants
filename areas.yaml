name: Bank/Tower Hill
description: Convenient for those staying in the Novotel Tower Bridge, but also
  easily accessible via the DLR (Bank Station, Tower Gateway Station), the
  Central Line (Bank Station), and the District Line (Monument Station, Tower
  Hill Station).  South across the river is the area we’ve labelled as
  “London Bridge”, which can be accessed by walking across Tower Bridge or
  London Bridge.  Whitechapel is to the east.
---
name: Canary Wharf
description: The northern part of the Isle of Dogs, developed in the late
  1980s/early 1990s from unused commercial dockland into one of London’s two
  main financial centres.  Note that many restaurants and bars here open
  weekdays only, to cater for the many office workers of the area.
  Accommodation includes the Britannia International, the Hilton London Canary
  Wharf, the Marriott West India Quay, the Radisson Blu Edwardian New
  Providence Wharf, and the Marlin Canary Wharf serviced apartments.  Easily
  reachable via the DLR (stations including Blackwall, Canary Wharf,
  Crossharbour, Heron Quays, South Quay, Westferry, and West India Quay) or
  the Jubilee Line (Canary Wharf Station).
---
name: Canning Town
description: Focused around Canning Town Station, which is a significant
  interchange point between different branches of the DLR, the Jubilee Line,
  and local bus services.  A varied selection of cafes, restaurants, and
  grocery shops covering cuisines from Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe can be
  found on Barking Road (follow signs in station for Way Out/Buses, exit onto
  bus concourse, cross road all the way across, turn left and walk under the
  flyover — don’t follow the blue cycle lane, just keep going forwards, and
  Barking Road then leads off to your right).
---
name: Central Line
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via Central Line stations such as Stratford.
---
name: District Line
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via District Line stations such as Mile End (also
  on the Central Line), Tower Hill, and West Ham (also on the DLR and Jubilee
  Line).
---
name: DLR
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via the DLR network.
---
name: East Ham
description: A large area of East London served by Upton Park and East Ham
  stations on the District Line.  Direct trains from Tower Hill Station, or
  change (cross-platform) from the Central Line at Mile End Station, or
  change (step-free via lifts) from the DLR or Jubilee Line at West Ham
  Station.  A wealth of small independent cafes and
  restaurants serve South Indian food at excellent prices — far too many to
  list them all here, so the adventurous are encouraged to explore along
  Green Street (turn left out of Upton Park Station — not step-free) and East
  Ham High Street (turn right out of East Ham Station — step-free access via
  lifts).  Facilities can be somewhat basic, but almost everywhere will have
  a good selection of vegetarian options, and several places are completely
  vegetarian.
---
name: East London Line
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via the East London Line on London Overground.
  Change to London Overground from the DLR at Shadwell Station or from the
  Jubilee Line at Canada Water Station.  Hoxton, Rotherhithe, Surrey Quays,
  and Wapping stations are all just a few stops from these interchanges, and
  all have nearby options worth the journey.  In particular, Kingsland Road,
  reached via Hoxton Station, is home to around two dozen Vietnamese
  restaurants (a representative sampling of which is included here).
---
name: ExCeL
description: Venues around ExCeL itself.  DLR stations are Custom House, Prince
  Regent, and Royal Victoria.
---
name: Greenwich
description: Home of the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Observatory,
  Greenwich Park, and more.  Served by the Lewisham branch of the DLR (Cutty
  Sark Station, Greenwich Station) and trains from London Bridge (Greenwich
  Station).
---
name: Limehouse
description: A sprawling area of East London, served by Limehouse Station and
  Westferry Station on the DLR.  Many of the venues here will likely mainly be
  of interest to those staying in the Marlin Limehouse serviced apartments,
  though some (including the Narrow and the Grapes) are worth travelling for.
---
name: London Bridge
description: Just south of the Thames, the area between London Bridge Station
  (Jubilee Line) and the south end of Tower Bridge (across which are Tower
  Gateway Station on the DLR and Tower Hill Station on the District Line).
  Everything in this area is within walking distance of the Hilton Tower Bridge.
  The eastern side is also close to Bermondsey Station, which is useful for
  those travelling in on the Jubilee Line from the east and wishing to avoid
  paying Zone 1 fares.
---
name: Stratford
description: A recently regenerated area, with the Westfield shopping centre
  and the Olympic Park.  Well-connected via the DLR (Stratford Station,
  Stratford High Street Station, Stratford International Station) and Jubilee
  Line (Stratford Station).  A small enclave around Maryland Station is
  walkable from Stratford Station, though the tired or lazy may prefer to take
  an overground train for 2 minutes to Maryland Station itself.  Several
  independent cafes and restaurants make it well worth looking beyond the
  chains of Westfield.
---
name: Whitechapel
description: London’s original “East End”, a large area served by the DLR
  (Shadwell Station), the District Line and Hammersmith & City Line (Aldgate
  East Station and Whitechapel Station), and the Circle Line and Metropolitan
  Line (Aldgate Station).  The western part of it is also walkable from the area
  we’ve designated as “Bank/Tower Hill”.
