name: Bank/Tower Hill
description: Convenient for those staying in the Novotel Tower Bridge, but also
  easily reachable via the DLR (Bank Station, Tower Gateway Station), the
  Central Line (Bank Station), and the District Line (Monument Station, Tower
  Hill Station).  South across the river is the area we’ve labelled as
  “London Bridge”, which can be reached by walking across Tower Bridge or
  London Bridge.  Whitechapel is to the east.
access: Bank Station and Tower Gateway Station are step-free accessible from
  the DLR only.  Other stations in this area all have mandatory steps.
---
name: Canary Wharf
description: The northern part of the Isle of Dogs, developed in the late
  1980s/early 1990s from unused commercial dockland into one of London’s two
  main financial centres.  Note that many restaurants and bars here open
  weekdays only, to cater for the many office workers of the area.
  Accommodation includes the Britannia International, the Hilton London Canary
  Wharf, the Marriott West India Quay, the Radisson Blu Edwardian New
  Providence Wharf, and the Marlin Canary Wharf serviced apartments.  Easily
  reachable via the DLR (stations including Blackwall, Canary Wharf,
  Crossharbour, Heron Quays, South Quay, Westferry, and West India Quay) or
  the Jubilee Line (Canary Wharf Station).
access: Canary Wharf Station and all DLR stations are step-free accessible.
---
name: Canning Town
description: Focused around Canning Town Station, which is a significant
  interchange point between different branches of the DLR, the Jubilee Line,
  and local bus services.  A varied selection of cafes, restaurants, and
  grocery shops covering cuisines from Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe can be
  found on Barking Road (follow signs in station for Way Out/Buses, exit onto
  bus concourse, cross road all the way across, turn left and walk under the
  flyover — don’t follow the blue cycle lane, just keep going forwards, and
  Barking Road then leads off to your right).
access: Canning Town Station is step-free accessible from both the Jubilee
  Line and the DLR.
---
name: Central Line
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via the Central Line from Stratford Station.
access: Unfortunately, the only step-free accessible station in our area of
  interest is Stratford Station.
---
name: District Line
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via the District Line.  Get on the District Line
  at Tower Hill Station, or change (cross-platform) from the Central Line
  at Mile End Station, or change (step-free via lifts) from the DLR or
  Jubilee Line at West Ham Station.  See also our “East Ham” section.
  Note that the Hammersmith &amp; City Line shares a route (and usually
  platforms) with the District Line between Aldgate East and Barking,
  so unless you need Tower Hill Station you can use either line.
access: The only step-free accessible way to get onto the District Line
  from our area of interest is via West Ham Station; a manual ramp may
  be required to get on and off District Line trains here.
  Both East Ham Station and Barking Station are step-free accessible via
  lifts, though again a manual ramp may be required
  and/or the gap between the platform and train may be large.  The lift at
  Barking Station is on platform 1 underneath the
  staircase, and is operated by railway staff — press the blue button on the
  communication system to the left of the lift to contact staff.  Access to platform 1 is
  cross-platform from platform 1a (left-hand side of eastbound District
  Line trains) and via a subway at the far end from all other platforms.
  Plaistow Station and Upton Park Station are not step-free accessible.
---
name: DLR
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via the DLR network.
access: All DLR stations are step-free accessible.
---
name: East Ham
description: A large area of East London served by Upton Park and East Ham
  stations on the District Line (see also “District Line” section).
  A wealth of small independent cafes and restaurants serve South
  Indian food at excellent prices — far too many to list them all here, so
  the adventurous are encouraged to explore along Green Street (turn left
  out of Upton Park Station) and East Ham High Street (turn right out of
  East Ham Station).  Facilities can be somewhat basic, but almost
  everywhere will have a good selection of vegetarian options, and several
  places are completely vegetarian.
access: "See the “District Line” section for accessibility information."
---
name: East London Line
description: Venues which aren’t in any of the main areas we list here, but
  which are easily reached via the East London Line on London Overground.
  Change to London Overground from the DLR at Shadwell Station (involves
  several steps) or from the Jubilee Line at Canada Water Station (step-free).
  Hoxton, Rotherhithe, Surrey Quays,
  and Wapping stations are all just a few stops from these interchanges, and
  all have nearby options worth the journey.  In particular, Kingsland Road,
  reached via Hoxton Station, is home to around two dozen Vietnamese
  restaurants, a representative sampling of which is included here.
  (Note that London Overground has multiple lines — the one from Stratford
  is <em>not</em> the East London Line, but taking this line to Dalston
  Kingsland Station allows a change to the East London Line at Dalston
  Junction Station which may be more convenient if heading for Hoxton
  Station.)
access: Hoxton Station is step-free accessible via lifts.  Venues near
  Rotherhithe Station and Surrey Quays Station are walking distance from
  Canada Water Station (which is step-free accessible).
---
name: ExCeL
description: Venues around ExCeL itself.  DLR stations are Custom House, Prince
  Regent, and Royal Victoria.
access: All DLR stations are step-free accessible.
---
name: Greenwich
description: Home of the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Observatory,
  Greenwich Park, and more.  Served by the Lewisham branch of the DLR (Cutty
  Sark Station, Greenwich Station) and trains from London Bridge (Greenwich
  Station).
access: All DLR stations are step-free accessible.  Greenwich Station is also
  step-free accessible from the London Bridge platforms, though a manual ramp
  may be required to get on and off the trains.
---
name: Limehouse
description: A sprawling area of East London, served by Limehouse Station and
  Westferry Station on the DLR.  Many of the venues here will likely mainly be
  of interest to those staying in the Marlin Limehouse serviced apartments,
  though some (including the Narrow and the Grapes) are worth travelling for.
access: All DLR stations are step-free accessible.
---
name: London Bridge
description: Just south of the Thames, the area between London Bridge Station
  (Jubilee Line) and the south end of Tower Bridge (across which are Tower
  Gateway Station on the DLR and Tower Hill Station on the District Line).
  Everything in this area is within walking distance of the Hilton Tower Bridge.
  The eastern side is also close to Bermondsey Station, which is useful for
  those travelling in on the Jubilee Line from the east and wishing to avoid
  paying Zone 1 fares.
access: London Bridge Station has step-free access to the Jubilee Line and
  most of the overground railway platforms, though a manual ramp may be
  required to get on and off the overground trains.
---
name: O2
description: The Millennium Dome is an architectural ode to the future created
  by a fiscal fiasco and rescued by telecoms giant O2 for far less than what it
  cost the country to build it. It’s a venue for major concerts so it’s often
  packed two hours before and an hour after a very famous person appears on
  stage. As of this writing, no major famous folks are scheduled to appear in
  the days running up to and after Loncon3. All restaurants are chains. Free
  O2 wifi throughout the O2. It’s on the Jubilee line (North Greenwich Station)
  and the jolly fun Emirates Air Line gondola lift that runs from Royal Docks to
  the Greenwich peninsula.
access: North Greenwich Station has step-free access to the Jubilee Line.  The
  Emirates Air Line also has step-free access at both ends, though larger
  wheelchairs/scooters may need to reverse into or out of the cabins.  The
  Millennium Dome and every restaurant in it is wheelchair accessible.
---
name: Stratford
description: A recently regenerated area, with the Westfield shopping centre
  and the Olympic Park.  Well-connected via the DLR (Stratford Station,
  Stratford High Street Station, Stratford International Station) and Jubilee
  Line (Stratford Station).  A small enclave around Maryland Station is
  walkable from Stratford Station, though the tired or lazy may prefer to take
  an overground train for 2 minutes to Maryland Station itself.  Several
  independent cafes and restaurants make it well worth looking beyond the
  chains of Westfield.
access: All DLR stations are step-free accessible.  Stratford Station is
  also step-free accessible from the Jubilee Line.  Maryland Station has
  mandatory steps.
---
name: Whitechapel
description: London’s original “East End”, a large area served by the DLR
  (Shadwell Station for the eastern side, Tower Gateway Station for the
  western side), the District Line and Hammersmith & City Line (Aldgate
  East Station and Whitechapel Station), and the Circle Line and Metropolitan
  Line (Aldgate Station).  The western part of it is also walkable from the area
  we’ve designated as “Bank/Tower Hill”.
access: Shadwell Station (DLR only; the London Overground part has steps) and
  Tower Gateway Station are step-free accessible.  Other stations in the area
  have mandatory steps.
