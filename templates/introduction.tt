<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Loncon 3 Restaurant Guide!  We’ve chosen to focus on restaurants, cafes, pubs, bars, and grocery shops that are easy to get to from either the ExCeL site or one or more of the con hotels, rather than expecting people to travel into Central London.  Nevertheless, our listings cover a good sampling of the many different cuisines and styles of venue available in London.</p>

<p>Most of the information below was gathered between February and June 2014, and so some of it might be out of date.  We recommend that you phone the restaurant in advance if any change in these details would cause a problem for you.</p>

<h3>Physical accessibility</h3>

<p>We provide information on physical accessibility, where possible.  This was gathered from restaurants via an in-person survey by a non-disabled person experienced in providing accessibility information, and it comes from personal observations rather than second-hand information from the restaurant staff.</p>

<p>Where we state that there’s step-free access with no further qualifiers, we mean that it’s possible to enter the restaurant, get to a table, and get to the toilets without encountering any steps.  Where we note the presence of an accessible toilet, this means a large cubicle, usually with grab bars, a low sink, and an alarm cord. Please note that in the UK, the “ground floor” is the floor at the ground level of a building, and the “first floor” is the one above this.</p>

<p>If you require step-free access and/or a large toilet cubicle, and you intend to dine out extensively during your visit, you may wish to acquire a <a href="https://crm.disabilityrightsuk.org/radar-nks-key">RADAR key</a> in advance.  This is a national key scheme which allows access to both public toilets and accessible toilets within pubs, bars, cafes, and restaurants.  Not all accessible toilets will be RADAR-locked, but many are.  Many establishments with a RADAR-locked toilet will have their own key, but in our experience these are frequently lost or misplaced, so we strongly recommend that you acquire your own.</p>

<p>When travelling, if you expect to need a manual ramp at your destination, please contact station staff before boarding a train, as most trains do not have on-board staff.  For additional information on step-free travel around London, see <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/transport-accessibility/">the Transport Accessibility section of the Transport for London website</a>.</p>

<h3>Child-friendliness</h3>

<p>We provide information on child-friendliness (highchairs, baby change facilities, etc) where possible.  Please remember that even if a restaurant does provide highchairs, there’s no guarantee that they won’t be already in use by other diners — so if you’re making an advance booking, it’s best to let the restaurant know how many highchairs you’ll require.</p>
